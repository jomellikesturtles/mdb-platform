# MDB Platform

Distributed application of mdb running across multiple Docker containers.

## Getting started

Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Mac or Windows. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) will be automatically installed. On Linux, make sure you have the latest version of [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

This solution uses Java Spring, Angular, ReactJS, Python, Node.js, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.

Run in this directory to build and run the app:

```shell
docker compose up
```

The `mdb-web-app` app will be running at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200), and the `admin-web-app` will be at [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200).

- [mdb-web-app](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/mdb-electron) frontend application written in Angular
- [mdb-admin-web-app](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/mdb-admin-web-app) in React.js. An internal tool.
- [mdb-bff-service](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/mdb-api) (mdb-api) in Spring
- [mdb-admin-bff-service](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/mdb-admin-bff-service) in Spring
- [media-data-gateway-service](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/media-data-gateway-service) in Spring which is the adapter service
- [user-data-gateway-service](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/user-data-gateway-service) in Spring which is the adapter service
- Postgres the RDBMS which stores data.
- Redis which caches between BFFs and gateway services.
- [mdb-crawler-service](https://github.com/jomellikesturtles/mdb-crawler-service) the crawler service. technology TBA

## Notes

## Roadmap
🚀 **Phase 1: The MVP (Version 1.0)**

**Theme:** "The Walking Skeleton"

**Goal:** A user can log in and view media. An admin can manually manage media and users.

In this phase, we prove the **Infrastructure** works. We do *not* implement the Crawler yet, as manual data entry, and the write is sufficient to test the frontend and microservices connectivity.

| **Service / Component** | **Features Included in MVP** |
| --- | --- |
| **Infrastructure** | mdb-platform (Docker Compose), Postgres. 
| **Media Gateway** | **CRUD API** for Movies (Title, Description, Poster URL, Stream Link). |
| **User Gateway** | Basic user profile storage. |
| **Admin Web App** | **Manual Entry Dashboard:** Forms to create/edit movies. |
| **Web App (User)** | **Home Page:** Grid of all movies.<br> **Details Page:**  Title, Poster, and a (dummy) "Play" button. <br> **Search**  Basic SQL Search (LIKE %query%) via Media Gateway. |
